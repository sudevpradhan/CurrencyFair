Main Algorithm
--------------
- Check if memcache present - if yes use this/ else use a flat file system
- Store each post message in diffrent Memcache/file entry. This insures there are never too may operations - view/edit trying to access the same entry at the same time 
- Rotate the storage keys - such that there are only a configurable MAX number of messages in the system
- Compute and store with cache expiry values when viewing - use time for expiry instead of hits as hits cannot be predcted
- Fetch computed data to display in graph i.e. the data with cache expiry - insure fetching effecient i.e. fetch all at once


Details
-------
- Takes messages in JSON at endpoint.
- Stores this Json in memcache if present otherwise uses a flat filesystem.
- Computes and displays data using google charts.
